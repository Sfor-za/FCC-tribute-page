            Here's a timeline of Plancks Life
        <ul id="tribute-info">
            <li>1858 : Planck was born in Kiel, Holstein</li>
            <li>1867 : His family moved to Munich, and Planck enrolled in the Maximilians gymnasium school</li>
            <li>1874 : Began his studies at the University of Munich. Under Philipp von Jolly's supervision</li>
            <li>1877 : He went to the Friedrich Wilhelms University in Berlin with Hermann von Helmholtz and Gustav
                Kirchhoff and Karl Weierstrass</li>
            <li> 1878 : Planck passed his qualifying exam</li>
            <li>1879 : He defended his dissertation, Über den zweiten Hauptsatz der mechanischen Wärmetheorie.(On the
                second law of thermodynamics)</li>
            <li>1880 : Planck had obtained the two highest academic degrees offered in Europe</li>
            <li>1885 : The University of Kiel appointed Planck as associate professor of theoretical physics</li>
            <li>1889 : He was named the successor to Kirchhoff's position at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität in
                Berlin</li>
            <li>1892 : Became a full professor</li>
            <li>1897 : He published his Treatise on Thermodynamics</li>
            <li>1900 : The first version of the famous Planck black-body radiation law was first proposed in a meeting
                of the DPG on 19 October</li>
            <li>1900 : He made the supposition, now known as the Planck postulate, that electromagnetic energy could be
                emitted only in quantized form, in other words, the energy could only be a multiple of an elementary
                unit: E=hv</li>

            <li>1907 : Planck was offered Boltzmann's position in Vienna, but turned it down to stay in Berlin</li>
            <li>1909 : As a University of Berlin professor, he was invited to become the Ernest Kempton Adams Lecturer
                in Theoretical Physics at Columbia University in New York City</li>
            <li>1918 : He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics</li>
            <li>1920s : Bohr, Heisenberg and Pauli had worked out the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics,
                but it was rejected by<b> Planck</b>, and by Schrödinger, Laue, and Einstein as well</li>
            <li>1926 : He retired from Berlin on 10 January and was succeeded by Erwin Schrödinger</li>
            <li>1944 : Planck's son Erwin was arrested by the Gestapo following the attempted assassination of Hitler in
                the 20 July plot</li>
            <li>1945 : Erwin was hanged at Berlin's Plötzensee Prison in January </li>
            <li>1947 : After the war had ended, Planck, his second wife, and their son were brought to a relative in
                Göttingen, where Planck died on October 4th </li>
        </ul>

            <i>"..."to believe" means "to recognize as a truth," and the knowledge of nature, continually advancing on
                incontestably safe tracks, has made it utterly impossible for a person possessing some training in
                natural science to recognize as founded on truth the many reports of extraordinary occurrences
                contradicting the laws of nature, of miracles which are still commonly regarded as essential supports
                and confirmations of religious doctrines, and which formerly used to be accepted as facts pure and
                simple, without doubt or criticism. The belief in miracles must retreat step by step before relentlessly
                and reliably progressing science and we cannot doubt that sooner or later it must vanish
                completely."</i>
